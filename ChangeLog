# ChangeLog file for monetdb-java
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Aug 17 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Implemented ResultSet method getNCharacterStream()
- In class MonetClob implemented methods getCharacterStream()
  and getCharacterStream(long pos, long length).  Method
  getCharacterStream() is called by DBeaver to fetch the Clob value.
  It used to throw a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException with message:
  "Method getCharacterStream() currently not supported" This caused
  DBeaver to log the exception and show NULL as the value on screen,
  which is incorrect.  This has been fixed.

* Fri Jul 28 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Compiled and released new jars: monetdb-jdbc-2.26.jar and updated jdbcclient.jar

* Thu Jul 13 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected implementation of PreparedStatement method
   setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int targetSqlType, int scaleOrLength)
  for the case the targetSqlType is Types.CLOB.
